Rune is a full framework for graphic design, we are using it mainly because of Rune.font addon and its support of paths.

*Rune.font*

Rune.font is plugin for Rune, it allows us to load a font and convert its outline to Rune.path objects or a series of polygons that we will be able to use withing p5xjs.
